### Abstract
In this project we will try to use machine learning to generate song lyrics depending on the genre wanted. 
A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

### Research questions
Can use machine learning to develop a program that generates a song lyrics according to the genre wanted?

### Dataset

Week 3: 
- Train the model and result analysis
Week 4: 
- Documentation
Week 5: 
- Presentation

### Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
