## TEXT-MINING-PROJECT REPOSITORY

### Abstract
The main goal of our project is to see how similar a lyrics generator can be to an artist in writing the new lyrics. More specifically, we will try to generate lyrics depending on a genre and try to compare it to real lyrics and newly humanly formed lyrics. The motivation for this project was the comparison between the capability of generating new lyrics based on a genre of a human and of a program. Programs in text mining have evolved enormously in the past two decades as well as the amount of music being produced and consumed, so we wanted to see how programs and humans differed in using previously read or heard lyrics to create new lyrics. Has humanity really evolved or has it been using lyrics previously written subsconciously to write lyrics. To try to understand better how lyrics formation works, the  project will try to use machine learning to generate song lyrics depending on the genre wanted and end up comparing it to someone who we will ask for us to do in place. 

### Research questions
Can use machine learning to develop a program that generates a song lyrics according to the genre wanted?
